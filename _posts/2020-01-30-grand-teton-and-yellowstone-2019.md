> Round II of the Nguyen Brothers Road Trip Extravaganza

In the middle of July 2019, my Dad and two younger brothers embarked on our annual road trip to visit a few national parks. The previous year we were in Utah, spending our time in Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Capitol Reef National Parks. This year we opted to head further north, with our sights set on Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.

On the first day of the trip we loaded all our camping gear into my mom's Subaru Forester and hit the road, destination: Twin Falls Idaho. That was going to be our intended stop for the night, however because I had become accustomed to making long drives solo, I persuaded my Dad to relay race our way to Grand Teton in one push.

In total, the drive up to Moose took around 14 hours, with an obligatory In-N-Out run in Reno, followed by a Denny's dinner in Twin Falls. The rest of the time was spent motoring out of California, through Nevada and Idaho, and up the windy mountain roads over into Wyoming.

## Grand Teton National Park

We pulled up to the Jenny Lake campground at around 3 AM. We were first in line for spots the following morning but had no where to sleep for the rest of the night. So, we just nodded our heads whatever way we could and caught a few restless hours of sleep in the car.

Once the sun rose and morning came, the host and hostess slowly let everyone in line into the campground to claim campsites. Since we were first in line we had the widest selection and had no difficulty selecting a nice site. Not far behind us was Jenny Lake, a sizable lake nestled at the foot of the Tetons.

There was a ferry that shuttled hikers and tourists to and from the opposing shores.
