> Round two of the "Father and Sons Road Trip Extravaganza"

In Summer 2019 my Dad, my brothers, and I embarked on our annual road trip to visit a few national parks. The previous year we were in Utah, spending our time in Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Capitol Reef National Parks. This year we opted to head further north towards Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.

On the first day of the trip we loaded all of our camping gear into the family Subaru Forester and hit the road, destination: Twin Falls, Idaho. That was supposed to be our intended stop for the night, however, as my dad and I often do, we opted to relay race our way to Grand Teton in one push.

In total, the drive up to Moose, Wyoming took around 14 hours, with the obligatory In-N-Out run in Reno, followed by a Denny's dinner in Twin Falls. The rest of the time was spent motoring out of California, through Nevada and Idaho, and finally into Wyoming.

We pulled up to the Jenny Lake campground at around 3 AM. Luckily, we were first in line for camping spots the following morning. The downside was we had nowhere to sleep that night besides the car. So, we tried our best to make the car as comfortable as possible and got caught a few fleeting hours of sleep.

Once the sun rose, the host and hostess began letting everyone into the campground to claim campsites. Since we were first in line we had the widest selection and had no difficulty selecting a nice site. Not far behind us was Jenny Lake, nestled at the foot of the Tetons.

There's a ferry service that shuttles hikers and tourists to and from the opposing shores of Jenny Lake, dropping them off near the access point to Hidden Falls. It's a nice touch but we wanted to get our legs moving after being confined in the car for so long, so we began our clockwise loop around the lake on foot.

The trail was mostly flat, rising up on the opposite side to a viewpoint that overlooked the lake. Looking east we could see the sweeping plains that dominated the area beyond the Tetons. After a few candid pictures to capture the moment, we dropped down and visited Hidden Falls to see what they had to offer.

On the way back from the falls, my youngest brother and I decided we wanted to run the rest of the way around Jenny Lake. We had heard from some other hikers that it wasn't too far. So, we left our packs with my dad and middle brother, who were opting for the ferry ride back across the lake, and started jogging.

What we had thought would be a short two mile run turned out to be closer to four miles of trail that meandered around the lake before going up river for a bit before crossing over to our side of the lake. By the time we got back to camp, my dad and middle brother were already changed and ready for a rinse in the lake to wash off the day's sweat.
