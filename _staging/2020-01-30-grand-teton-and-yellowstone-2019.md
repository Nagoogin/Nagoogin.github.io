> Round two of the "Father and Sons Road Trip Extravaganza"

In Summer 2019 my Dad, my brothers, and I embarked on our annual road trip to visit a few national parks. The previous year we were in Utah, spending our time in Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Capitol Reef National Parks. This year we opted to head further north towards Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.

On the first day of the trip we loaded all of our camping gear into the family Subaru Forester and hit the road, destination: Twin Falls, Idaho. That was supposed to be our intended stop for the night, however, as my dad and I often do, we opted to relay race our way to Grand Teton in one push.

In total, the drive up to Moose, Wyoming took around 14 hours, with the obligatory In-N-Out run in Reno, followed by a Denny's dinner in Twin Falls. The rest of the time was spent motoring out of California, through Nevada and Idaho, and finally into Wyoming.

## Grand Teton National Park

We pulled up to the Jenny Lake campground at around 3 AM. Luckily, we were first in line for camping spots the following morning. The downside was we had nowhere to sleep that night besides the car. So, we tried our best to make the car as comfortable as possible and got caught a few fleeting hours of sleep.

Once the sun rose, the host and hostess began letting everyone into the campground to claim campsites. Since we were first in line we had the widest selection and had no difficulty selecting a nice site. Not far behind us was Jenny Lake, nestled at the foot of the Tetons.

There was a ferry that shuttled hikers and tourists to and from the opposing shores.
